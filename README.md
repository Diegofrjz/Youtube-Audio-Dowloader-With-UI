# Youtube-Audio-Dowloader-With-UI
A python based program that downloads audio from youtube videos (MP3 Format)
This is the version with UI, if you want the version without UI and only with commands, check my repositories.
HOW TO USE:
For the program to work correctly, you need (tkinter and pytube) libraries
Install the libraries using the "pip" function
The program is executed by opening the terminal in the folder where they downloaded the ".py" file
To open the program, in the terminal run the command:  py MP3DowloaderWithUI.py
I did the program in Spanish, but basically you enter the URL of the YouTube video first and then where you want the file to be saved
the program will start (it seems to freeze) but they just have to wait
